# ACID within transactions:
#     atomicity - whole transaction as single unit - or commit, or rollback
#     consistency - transferring from one consistent state to another consistent state - or commit, or rollback, without any bugs
#     isolation - cant see other transactions till commit - or commit to let other see changes, or rollback
#     durability - if commit - then cant rollback


# isolation levels:
# 1) read uncommitted - transaction can see other uncommitted transactions
set transaction isolation level read uncommitted;

# 2) read committed - transaction can see changes committed when this one started, but what this one changed - cant be seen by others till commit (can make one command and get 2 different results)
set transaction isolation level read committed;

# 3) repeatable read - the same as previous, but all commands give the same result, set as default in mysql (can see phantom row if chosen row sets and other transaction added / deleted rows)
set transaction isolation level repeatable read;
-- default

# 4) serializable - the same as previous, but without phantom rows conflict, it blocks every row that this transaction is reading (so conflicts can happen while blocking)
set transaction isolation level serializable;
